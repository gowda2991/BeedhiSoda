        insertIntoExcerptsTable(db,1,"Using Ikea Effect in Making Products Users Love","The more users invest time and effort into a product or service, the more they value it. In fact, there is ample evidence to suggest that our labor leads to love. In a 2011 study, Dan Ariely, Michael Norton, and Daniel Mochon measured the effect of labor on how people value things. 4 U. S. college students in America were given instructions to assemble an origami crane or frog. After the exercise students were asked to purchase their creation, bidding up to $1. Assemblers were informed that a random number between zero and one hundred was to be drawn. If it exceeded their reservation price in cents, the assemblers would return empty-handed—but if it was equal to or less than their bid, they would pay their bid and keep the origami. Meanwhile, a separate group of students located in another room, unaware of the identity of the assemblers, were asked to bid on their origami using the same procedure. Similarly, a third independent group was asked to bid on expert-made origami under the same criteria. The results showed that those who made their own origami animals valued their creation five times higher than the second group's valuation, and nearly as high as the expert-made origami values. In other words, those who invested labor associated greater value with their paper creations simply because they had worked on them. Ariely calls this the IKEA effect. IKEA, the world's largest furniture retailer, sells affordable, ready-to-assemble household furnishings. The Swedish company's key innovation is its packaging process, which allows the company to decrease labor costs, increase distribution efficiency, and better utilize the real estate in its stores. Unlike its competitors who sell preassembled merchandise, IKEA puts its customers to work. It turns out there's a hidden benefit to making users invest physical effort in assembling the product—by asking customers to assemble their own furniture, Ariely believes they adopt an irrational love of the furniture they built, just like the test subjects did in the origami experiments. Businesses that leverage user effort confer higher value to their products simply because their users have put work into them. The users have invested in the products through their labor.",0);
        insertIntoExcerptsTable(db,2,"AirBnB taking Jobs' 3-Click Rule Seriously","The very first Airbnb product was simply the oddball idea and a WordPress website, but when it came time to get ready for the third launch, at the DNC in Denver, the founders had expanded their vision, going from a simple platform for housing supply for sold-out conferences to a website where you could book a room in someone's home as easily as you could book a hotel room. But from the start, Chesky and Gebbia were emphatic about certain things regarding the website and the experience: specifically, it had to be frictionless, it had to be easy. The listings had to look beautiful. And, based on the famous three-click rule from Steve Jobs, a design hero of Chesky and Gebbia's — when Jobs conceived the iPod, he wanted it to never be more than just three clicks away from a song — the founders wanted their users to never be more than three clicks away from a booking. In fact, what so many investors had seen as a red flag during those early pitch meetings — that Chesky and Gebbia were designers from RISD who lacked technical background — turned out to be one of their biggest assets. To them, design was not just about an object, or in their case a website; it was about how something worked — from the product to the interface to the experience. Later, this approach would infiltrate every aspect of their business, including the way they built the culture, conceived the offices, structured the company, and ran board meetings.",0);
        insertIntoExcerptsTable(db, 3,"What You See Is All There Is","On September 3, plaintiff David Thornton, a forty-three-year-old union field representative, was present in Thrifty Drug Store #168, performing a routine union visit. Within ten minutes of his arrival, a store manager confronted him and told him he could no longer speak with the union employees on the floor of the store. Instead, he would have to see them in a back room while they were on break. Such a request is allowed by the union contract with Thrifty Drug but had never before been enforced. When Mr. Thornton objected, he was told that he had the choice of conforming to these requirements, leaving the store, or being arrested. At this point, Mr. Thornton indicated to the manager that he had always been allowed to speak to employees on the floor for as much as ten minutes, as long as no business was disrupted, and that he would rather be arrested than change the procedure of his routine visit. The manager then called the police and had Mr. Thornton handcuffed in the store for trespassing. After he was booked and put into a holding cell for a brief time, all charges were dropped. Mr. Thornton is suing Thrifty Drug for false arrest. In addition to this background material, which all participants read, different groups were exposed to presentations by the lawyers for the two parties. Naturally, the lawyer for the union organizer described the arrest as an intimidation attempt, while the lawyer for the store argued that having the talk in the store was disruptive and that the manager was acting properly. Some participants, like a jury, heard both sides. The lawyers added no useful information that you could not infer from the background story. The participants were fully aware of the setup, and those who heard only one side could easily have generated the argument for the other side. Nevertheless, the presentation of one-sided evidence had a very pronounced effect on judgments. Furthermore, participants who saw one-sided evidence were more confident of their judgments than those who saw both sides. This is just what you would expect if the confidence that people experience is determined by the coherence of the story they manage to construct from available information. It is the consistency of the information that matters for a good story, not its completeness. Indeed, you will often find that knowing little makes it easier to fit everything you know into a coherent pattern.",0);
        insertIntoExcerptsTable(db, 4,"Moments Of Non-Fuckery Define Our Lives","What's interesting about the backwards law is that it's called \"backwards\" for a reason: not giving a fuck works in reverse. If pursuing the positive is a negative, then pursuing the negative generates the positive. The pain you pursue in the gym results in better all-around health and energy. The failures in business are what lead to a better understanding of what's necessary to be successful. Being open with your insecurities paradoxically makes you more confident and charismatic around others. The pain of honest confrontation is what generates the greatest trust and respect in your relationships. Suffering through your fears and anxieties is what allows you to build courage and perseverance. Seriously, I could keep going, but you get the point. Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience. Any attempt to escape the negative, to avoid it or quash it or silence it, only backfires. The avoidance of suffering is a form of suffering. The avoidance of struggle is a struggle. The denial of failure is a failure. Hiding what is shameful is itself a form of shame. Pain is an inextricable thread in the fabric of life, and to tear it out is not only impossible, but destructive: attempting to tear it out unravels everything else with it. To try to avoid pain is to give too many fucks about pain. In contrast, if you're able to not give a fuck about the pain, you become unstoppable. In my life, I have given a fuck about many things. I have also not given a fuck about many things. And like the road not taken, it was the fucks not given that made all the difference. Chances are you know somebody in your life who, at one time or another, did not give a fuck and then went on to accomplish amazing feats. Perhaps there was a time in your own life when you simply did not give a fuck and excelled to some extraordinary height. For myself, quitting my day job in finance after only six weeks to start an Internet business ranks pretty high up there in my own \"didn't give a fuck\" hall of fame. Same with deciding to sell most of my possessions and move to South America. Fucks given? None. Just went and did it. These moments of non-fuckery are the moments that most define our lives. The major switch in careers; the spontaneous choice to drop out of college and join a rock band; the decision to finally dump that deadbeat boyfriend whom you caught wearing your pantyhose a few too many times.",0);
        insertIntoExcerptsTable(db, 6,"The Koshy's and Bangalore's English Crowd","Then there was MTR. Founded by Yajna Narayana Maiya, who had already built a reputation as a skilled cook, Mavalli Tiffin Room was situated opposite the main gate of Lal Bagh Gardens. With gentlemen like C. V. Raman and Arcot Ramasamy Mudaliar, then Diwan of Mysore, dining at MTR, this establishment became a historical landmark. It was so designed that customers had to pass by an open kitchen and see its sanitized spotlessness before seating themselves. Beverages were served in silverware. When rice became scarce during the Second World War the Maiyas experimented with semolina, leading to the invention of rava idli, a hot staple today in South Indian menus the world over. The leadership position MTR gained during its early phase remained with it despite an ownership restructuring within the family in 2007. But there was a significant section of the population in Bangalore that remained unimpressed. After all, what Udupi symbolized was traditional Brahmin fare. While that was fine with multitudes of aficionados, Brahmin and otherwise, it was not good enough for the 'English' crowd—always a prominent component of Bangalore's social and cultural life. The English crowd could hardly find sustenance, let alone inspiration, in the sattvik virtues of MTR and Veena Stores, of Vidyarthi Bhavan and Brahmins' Coffee Bar. That was because the English crowd was not only colonial in its orientation but proud of it; not only non-vegetarian in its ideology but keen to flaunt it. More Cantonmentarian than Basavangudian in its chemistry, the English crowd liked its beef well done, its pork vindalooed to perfection and its fish now fried, now curried, with pride. They found their saviour in Koshy's. The confluence of elements could not have been more propitious for this meaty venture. The year was 1940, when British troops were a visible presence in Cantonment. The Koshy who founded what became an instant landmark was a Syrian Christian from Kerala, the significance being that Syrian Christian devotion to beef, mutton and fish is almost canonical. He was also a strategist who arranged to locate his restaurant at one end of the vast compound of St. Mark's Cathedral. Originally named Parade Cafe, it was adjacent to the Cantonment's main thoroughfare, South Parade (M. G. Road). On the other side of the cafe was Bowring Institute, teeming with Tommies. Prem Koshy, senior among the third generation of brothers now running the restaurant, said: 'Our fish and chips had pride of place since the war years. I remember my grandfather telling us how the troops would come from Bowring, take fish and roast chicken in wax-paper boxes and sit on South Parade benches to eat. Our fish and chips is still number one.' After Independence Koshy's offered an ambience that was a cross between a London pub and a Paris cafe. This turned the place into the favourite meeting point for local Jean-Paul Sartres and Ernest Hemingways, for artists, theatre personalities, poets, journalists and social figures. Many of them would often express disillusionment, though, with Koshy's premises becoming dilapidated as the furniture remained unchanged and unpolished for half a century. 'Valued customers' are given French fries and smilies—smiley fries—on the house. One of them said: 'After five years of custom I get fried potatoes. I'd rather sit in a clean, well-lighted place.' The state government ignored all that and posted a YouTube video aimed at tourists. It was called 'Breakfast at Koshy's'. They did not do that for MTR. The English crowd matters.",0);

I always recall what Harshad Bhansali, my first boss at TML, and a friend, philosopher and guide, used to say about ensuring a pricing that first created and then reflected brand value: 'Any clown can sell gold at the price of silver. If you're truly smart, show me how to sell gold at Tiffany's prices'. To a great extent, I believe I endeavoured, consciously and unconsciously, to follow this basic principle at HMI too. The first instance of this approach to pricing was probably witnessed during the introduction of the Santro Euro 2 version in May 1999. Years of dealing with Indian consumers had taught me that consumers tend to consider a company that is able to constantly push its price line higher as reflecting both its own sense of confidence about its product quality and the consumer's acceptance of this perception. This leads to a virtuous cycle of greater consumer acceptance, greater sales, greater profitability, greater investments in product development and quality, and in turn even greater consumer acceptance.",0);
        insertIntoExcerptsTable(db,1,"How Variablity Impacts Users","In the 1950s psychologist B. F. Skinner conducted experiments to understand how variability impacted animal behavior. First, Skinner placed pigeons inside a box rigged to deliver a food pellet to the birds every time they pressed a lever. Similar to Olds's and Milner's lab mice, the pigeons learned the cause-and-effect relationship between pressing the lever and receiving the food. In the next part of the experiment Skinner added variability. Instead of providing a pellet every time a pigeon tapped the lever, the machine discharged food after a random number of taps. Sometimes the lever dispensed food, other times not. Skinner revealed that the intermittent reward dramatically increased the number of times the pigeons tapped the lever. Adding variability increased the frequency of the pigeons' completing the intended action. Skinner's pigeons tell us a great deal about what helps drive our own behaviors. More recent experiments reveal that variability increases activity in the nucleus accumbens and spikes levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine, driving our hungry search for rewards. Researchers observed increased dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens in experiments involving monetary rewards as well as in a study of heterosexual men viewing images of attractive women's faces. Variable rewards can be found in all sorts of products and experiences that hold our attention. They fuel our drive to check e-mail, browse the web, or bargain-shop. ",0);
        insertIntoExcerptsTable(db, 2,"Paul Graham's advice on winning Europe Market","During the first Internet boom, a trio of brothers in Germany — Marc, Alexander, and Oliver Samwer — started making a living taking the ideas of the most successful U.S. tech start-ups and cloning them abroad. Their Berlin-based venture capital firm had funded the launch of clones of eBay, Zappos, and Amazon. In 2007 they started another firm, Rocket Internet, to apply this same strategy to the new crop of Internet start-ups. Their playbook was always the same: start copycat websites in Europe early, while the originals were still focused primarily on the United States and before they had the bandwidth and capital for overseas expansion; spend lavishly to grow them almost overnight to dominate the market; and then sell the idea back to the original company, which would by that point pay a huge premium to reclaim \"ownership\" of its own brand overseas. In 2010 the three had focused on Groupon, to great success — Groupon ended up buying the clone for a reported $170 million — and in 2011 they turned their attention to Airbnb. They started a company called Wimdu and its Chinese subsidiary, Airizu, raised $90 million, and within a few months had hired four hundred employees, opened more than a dozen offices, and claimed ten thousand listings. According to Airbnb, it started to hear from members of its platform in Europe about Wimdu's aggressive tactics, which included poaching listings from Airbnb's nascent business there and soliciting hosts to switch to Wimdu. \"It was an all-out ground war,\" says Sequoia's Alfred Lin. When Airbnb first heard about the activity, it sent out an e-mail to its community, warning its users not to engage with these \"scam artists.\" Airbnb was at a serious disadvantage. It comprised only forty people at the time, and they knew they needed to claim the European market, and fast — Airbnb couldn't call itself a travel company and not be available all over the world, particularly in Europe. Sure enough, soon the Samwer brothers made a proposition to Airbnb to sell it Wimdu. It prompted a major moment of soul-searching for Airbnb. By now having access to the top minds in Silicon Valley, as Chesky recounted to Hoffman's students, he asked for advice from a growing panel of high-octane advisers: Mark Zuckerberg, Andrew Mason, Paul Graham, and Hoffman. Everyone had a different opinion: Mason, he said, having just gone through the experience, told him Wimdu had the potential to kill Airbnb. Zuckerberg, Chesky said, advised him not to buy, because whoever had the best product would win. In the end, the advice Chesky took came from Paul Graham, who told him that the difference between Airbnb and Wimdu was that Airbnb owners were missionaries, and Wimdu owners were mercenaries. Missionaries, he told him, usually win. In what Chesky would later call a \"bet the company\" moment, the cofounders decided not to buy Wimdu, mainly for the reason Graham mentioned: Chesky didn't want to absorb four hundred new employees who he felt were mercenaries and whom Airbnb had had no say in hiring. They also decided that since the Samwer brothers likely had no interest in running the company long-term — their whole business model revolved around selling companies, not running them — the best revenge was to force them to actually run the giant company they'd just built. \"You had the baby, now you've got to raise the child, and you're stuck with it,\" as he told Hoffman.",0);

Until a few decades ago, the only way to study associations was to ask many people questions such as, \"What is the first word that comes to your mind when you hear the word DAY?\" The researchers tallied the frequency of responses, such as \"night,\" \"sunny,\" or \"long.\" In the 1980s, psychologists discovered that exposure to a word causes immediate and measurable changes in the ease with which many related words can be evoked. If you have recently seen or heard the word EAT, you are temporarily more likely to complete the word fragment SO_P as SOUP than as SOAP. The opposite would happen, of course, if you had just seen WASH. We call this a priming effect and say that the idea of EAT primes the idea of SOUP, and that WASH primes SOAP. Priming effects take many forms. If the idea of EAT is currently on your mind (whether or not you are conscious of it), you will be quicker than usual to recognize the word SOUP when it is spoken in a whisper or presented in a blurry font. And of course you are primed not only for the idea of soup but also for a multitude of food-related ideas, including fork, hungry, fat, diet, and cookie. If for your most recent meal you sat at a wobbly restaurant table, you will be primed for wobbly as well.",0);

Tehal Singh, her husband, was a daily wage-earner and the couple had three sons and two daughters. Two of Shanti Devi's sons were adults and helped their father while the youngest, a \"late and unexpected arrival\", was four years old and obviously his mother's pet. The two daughters called Babli and Rajkumari studied in a government-run school, and helped Shanti in her daily chores. Tehal Singh's family was part of a nomadic Sikh community because of which they had little or tenous links with either Punjab or Punjabiyat. But on that day, they were obligated into accepting the Sikh identity which so far had meant visits to local gurudwaras and offering prayers to Guru Nanak's picture in their window-less room. Shanti was quoted by a reputed scholar —who will be introduced a little later—for saying something illuminating, a sentence that encapsulated the sentiment of thousands of Sikhs in Delhi and other parts of India: 'All we wanted was to lead a quiet and peaceful life. We did not want to die for other people's ideas.' Much like other localities, word was out that, \"They are looking for Sardars… the women and children will be spared.\" Tehal Singh decided to go into hiding with his three sons and opted for a house that seemed abandoned and was locked from the outside. Although Shanti pleaded with her husband to give her the custody of their youngest child, he refused arguing that as a woman, she was feeble-minded and wouldn't be able to take care of him! Dejected, Shanti made her way with the other Sikh women to the terrace of a house close by, but sent word through one of her daughters, the ten-year-old Babli to reason with her father to hand over their last born. The girl returned without the child but was soon sent back because the women on the terrace saw a mob descending on the locked house where Tehal was hiding. In a few moments, copious amounts of kerosene was poured on the house and set on fire. Babli rushed back once again and pleaded with the men to let go of her youngest brother but to no avail. And for hours after that, Shanti was numbed into imagining the agonising cries of her little child in the horrifying inferno. She felt let down by her husband and Babli who had failed to negotiate with her father and the mob. That night when Shanti sat in funereal silence in front of the house that had turned into a smouldering cremation ground for the four male members of her family, little did she know that henceforth her life would be inextricably linked with Mita Bose and Veena Das, the world renowned anthropologist, who was then a professor in Delhi University. Mita was particularly drawn to Shanti's tragedy which was starkly manifest at the Rani Bagh relief camp that had sprung up close to Punjabi Bagh. On the other hand, Veena was struck by the Sikh woman's peculiar staccato style of speech. Veena later wrote in her book, Life and Words: Violence and The Descent Into The Ordinary, that the first few words Shanti said to her was: 'I want sukh (peace)—won't you give me sukh?' Initially Veena had failed to understand its import. Years later, she deciphered that Shanti had asked for death.",0);

A much-bandied about word in corporate board rooms and market places that instantly brings to mind heady visualisations of path-breaking creativity and unprecedented application of thought. Very often the reality on the ground is not far behind. Organisations have innovated out of their skin and provided value to the paying consumer in ways previously uncharted. While 3M has given the world the ubiquitous Post-its and Apple the chart-busting iPad, Dell's direct-to-consumer model, Wal-Mart's supply chain innovations and Google's mind-numbing array of internet technologies add to the list of innovations that stand testimony to the value creativity can bring to the market. CRISIL was no different when it came to recognising the fact that innovation was key to building an organisation that can make an impact. Be it its pioneering Independent Equity Research, the CRISIL Cards or the SME Rating product, the rating company started at Nirlon House by Pradip Shah was quick off the blocks in churning out first-of-its-kind offerings in a business environment that was largely not conducive to fresh thought. What was different however was whom it innovated for. CRISIL's Ratings business in particular, was in a unique situation where the paying customer had no control over the outcome of the engagement. The customer paid to get rated and the rating it received influenced its clients in turn. A lower rating meant lesser investment and fewer investors while a high rating fuelled market interest in the company getting rated. Very unusually, the independent mindset and unbiased work ethic adopted by CRISIL meant that the paying customer had no way of demanding a specific rating by applying undue influence. This ran counter to the basic nature of the relationship between customer and service provider. Here, the customer was not king. Given this lopsided equation, all rating decisions were made with the customer's customers and the public good in mind. All innovations and best practices were targeted at the larger populace of investing communities and market participants. In the process, CRISIL had set off on a path of enabling market efficiencies the day it rated its first client. What was also distinctly unique to CRISIL was the manner in which it created a self-sustaining DNA of innovation. Right from the formative years, the corporate mindset retained a marked bias for development vis-à-vis mere growth. CEO after CEO was inclined to look beyond top-line or bottom-line growth and explore avenues for well-rounded development of the organisation. As Rao remarks: \"Growing old is mandatory, but growing up is optional and that is what CRISIL's management has always endeavoured to do.\" Thus monetary profits were relegated to the status of an 'effect' while advancement of the organisation along loftier dimensions of public good and investor well-being became the driving 'cause'.",0);

The poster to the left depicts Mars as it is today-a cold, barren red orb.The poster on the right shows a Mars with a humongous greenlandmass surrounded by oceans. The planet has been heated up and transformed to suit humans. Musk fully intends to try and make this happen. Turning humans into space colonizers is his stated life's purpose. \"I would like to die thinking that humanity has a bright future,\" he said. \"If we can solve sustainable energy and be well on our way to becoming a multiplanetary species with a self-sustaining civilization on another planet-to cope with a worst-case scenario happening and extinguishing human consciousness-then,\" and here he paused for a moment, \"I think that would be really good.\"\n\nIf some of the things that Musk says and does sound absurd, that's because on one level they very much are. On this occasion,for example, Musk's assistant had just handed him some cookies and-cream ice cream with sprinkles on top, and he then talked earnestly about saving humanity while a blotch of the dessert hung from his lower lip.\n\nMusk's ready willingness to tackle impossible things has turned him into a deity in Silicon Valley, where fellow CEOs like Page speak of him in reverential awe, and budding entrepreneurs strive \"to be like Elon\" just as they had been striving in years past to mimic Steve Jobs. Silicon Valley, though, operates within a warped version of reality, and outside the confines of its shared fantasy, Musk often comes off as a much more polarizing figure. He's the guy with the electric cars, solar panels, and rockets ped sling false hope. Forget Steve Jobs. Musk is a sci-fi version of P.T.

First, he asked them how many users they had, and they told him not many at all — only a hundred, if that, they said. He told them not to worry, that it's much, much better to have one hundred users who love you than one million users who \"sort of like you.\" It's a tenet that flies in the face of conventional Silicon Valley wisdom, which prioritizes scale and growth above all else, but it sank in, and it gave them hope. Next, he asked them about these users. Where were they, exactly? The founders told them they were mainly in New York City. Graham paused, then repeated back to them what they had just told him: \"So, you're in Mountain View, and your users are in New York?\" he asked. They looked at each other, then back at him. \"Yeah,\" they said. \"What are you still doing here?\" Graham said to them. \"Go to New York! Go to your users.\" So to their users they went. For the next three months, Gebbia and Chesky flew to New York every weekend. While Blecharczyk stayed behind coding, they went door-to-door, trudging through the snow and meeting or bunking with every user they could. They learned a lot from talking to their customers, but they learned more by simply parking themselves in their living rooms and observing them as they used their product online. Chesky and Gebbia quickly identified two pain points: people had trouble pricing their properties, and photos were a huge problem area. Users didn't take very good ones, and back in 2009 many people still didn't know how to upload them properly. As a result, homes that looked inviting in person looked tired and dingy on the site. So they decided to offer to send professional photographers to each host's home at no charge. But they had no money, so Chesky borrowed a camera from a RISD friend and did it himself, often knocking on the door as the \"photographer\" to the same hosts he'd visited the day before as the CEO. Chesky was also a one-man payment system, often taking a checkbook ledger out of his backpack and writing individual paper checks to the hosts they visited. Any customer-service calls went to Gebbia, who took them on his cell phone.

Of course, your message will be true, but that is not necessarily enough for people to believe that it is true. It is entirely legitimate for you to enlist cognitive ease to work in your favor, and studies of truth illusions provide specific suggestions that may help you achieve this goal. The general principle is that anything you can do to reduce cognitive strain will help, so you should first maximize legibility. Compare these two statements: Adolf Hitler was born in 1892. Adolf Hitler was born in 1887. Both are false (Hitler was born in 1889), but experiments have shown that the first is more likely to be believed. More advice: if your message is to be printed, use high-quality paper to maximize the contrast between characters and their background. If you use color, you are more likely to be believed if your text is printed in bright blue or red than in middling shades of green, yellow, or pale blue. If you care about being thought credible and intelligent, do not use complex language where simpler language will do. My Princeton colleague Danny Oppenheimer refuted a myth prevalent among undergraduates about the vocabulary that professors find most impressive. In an article titled \"Consequences of Erudite Vernacular Utilized Irrespective of Necessity: Problems with Using Long Words Needlessly,\" he showed that couching familiar ideas in pretentious language is taken as a sign of poor intelligence and low credibility. In addition to making your message simple, try to make it memorable. Put your ideas in verse if you can; they will be more likely to be taken as truth. Participants in a much cited experiment read dozens of unfamiliar aphorisms, such as: Woes unite foes. Little strokes will tumble great oaks. A fault confessed is half redressed. Other students read some of the same proverbs transformed into nonrhyming versions: Woes unite enemies. Little strokes will tumble great trees. A fault admitted is half redressed. The aphorisms were judged more insightful when they rhymed than when they did not. Finally, if you quote a source, choose one with a name that is easy to pronounce. Participants in an experiment were asked to evaluate the prospects of fictitious Turkish companies on the basis of reports from two brokerage firms. For each stock, one of the reports came from an easily pronounced name (e.g., Artan) and the other report came from a firm with an unfortunate name (e.g., Taahhut). The reports sometimes disagreed. The best procedure for the observers would have been to average the two reports, but this is not what they did. They gave much more weight to the report from Artan than to the report from Taahhut.",0);

The band had just been signed to a record deal, and they were about to record their first album. But a couple days before recording began, the band showed the guitarist the door—no warning, no discussion, no dramatic blowout; they literally woke him up one day by handing him a bus ticket home. As he sat on the bus back to Los Angeles from New York, the guitarist kept asking himself: How did this happen? What did I do wrong? What will I do now? Record contracts didn't exactly fall out of the sky, especially for raucous, upstart metal bands. Had he missed his one and only shot? But by the time the bus hit L.A., the guitarist had gotten over his self-pity and had vowed to start a new band. He decided that this new band would be so successful that his old band would forever regret their decision. He would become so famous that they would be subjected to decades of seeing him on TV, hearing him on the radio, seeing posters of him in the streets and pictures of him in magazines. They'd be flipping burgers somewhere, loading vans from their shitty club gigs, fat and drunk with their ugly wives, and he'd be rocking out in front of stadium crowds live on television. He'd bathe in the tears of his betrayers, each tear wiped dry by a crisp, clean hundred-dollar bill. And so the guitarist worked as if possessed by a musical demon. He spent months recruiting the best musicians he could find—far better musicians than his previous bandmates. He wrote dozens of songs and practiced religiously. His seething anger fueled his ambition; revenge became his muse. Within a couple years, his new band had signed a record deal of their own, and a year after that, their first record would go gold. The guitarist's name was Dave Mustaine, and the new band he formed was the legendary heavy-metal band Megadeth. Megadeth would go on to sell over 25 million albums and tour the world many times over. Today, Mustaine is considered one of the most brilliant and influential musicians in the history of heavy-metal music. Unfortunately, the band he was kicked out of was Metallica, which has sold over 180 million albums worldwide. Metallica is considered by many to be one of the greatest rock bands of all time. And because of this, in a rare intimate interview in 2003, a tearful Mustaine admitted that he couldn't help but still consider himself a failure. Despite all that he had accomplished, in his mind he would always be the guy who got kicked out of Metallica. We're apes. We think we're all sophisticated with our toaster ovens and designer footwear, but we're just a bunch of finely ornamented apes. And because we are apes, we instinctually measure ourselves against others and vie for status.  Mustaine's metric of being better than Metallica likely helped him launch an incredibly successful music career. But that same metric later tortured him in spite of his success.

I looked at my watch, and realized we would be a few minutes early for the meeting with the Minister for Home Affairs. I told my aide-de-camp Captain Prakash to tell the pilot vehicle to slow down slightly. A week after I had taken over as the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Naxalite-Maoists owing allegiance to the outlawed Communist Party of India (Maoist) ambushed and killed seventy-six jawans from the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) near Chintalnar village in the Dantewada district of Chhattisgarh. Nearly eighty men had made up the CRPF/police team that had been on an 'area domination' exercise in the Bastar tribal region, an area rich in natural resources. Like the rest of the country, all of us at Army Headquarters were saddened by the incident and the tragic loss of lives. This was one of the bloodiest attacks ever on our security forces, and by the end of the day we had a fair idea of how the CRPF boys had walked into an ambush. The next day, at an interaction with the press, I was asked how a large party of armed jawans could be completely annihilated. After expressing my outrage and the army's solidarity with our fallen comrades, I said it hardly mattered if it was the Border Security Force (BSF), the Assam Rifles, the Indian Army or the CRPF; for any ambush to succeed so dramatically, the organization concerned had to look within itself and review training and operating procedures. Even though this was not on the agenda of the media interaction, the press latched on to this remark and sensationalized the comment, saying, 'Army chief faults the training of the CRPF'. In the ensuing days, the Ministry of Home Affairs seemed to feel I had encroached on to its turf and there were indications that they were none too happy about my comments (although subsequent findings of the inquiry commission fully supported what I had said). This discomfort was possibly aided by the fact that there was much talk around this time, at various levels, about the army's possible deployment against the Naxalite-Maoist movement. (Though keeping a close watch on the Naxalite-Maoists, the army was not yet directly involved in any way.) Three weeks had passed since the Dantewada massacre. Owing to various other commitments, the meeting with the home minister had remained pending. Prior to joining politics, Palaniappan Chidambaram had been a corporate lawyer. He had been a key member of the previous two Congress governments. In the wake of the Mumbai terror attack in 2008, Chidambaram had been made the Minister for Home Affairs. Upon taking office, he had promised to tackle the Naxalite-Maoist insurgency on a war footing. With the latest setback hanging in the air and my perceived 'stepping on their turf', I was pretty certain that the official call on the minister would be coloured by the Dantewada event. The vehicles stopped outside North Block and the security staff led me to the office of the minister. I was ushered in and greeted the minister who was, as always, attired in his trademark crisp whites. He courteously led me to the sitting area at one end of the room. 'So how are things with you, General?' 'All well with the army, Hon'ble Minister.' Without beating about the bush, Chidambaram came straight to the point. 'You know the Naxal problem is a major national issue. So why do you oppose the deployment of the army in Naxal areas?' This confirmed my fear that the government was indeed considering asking the army to deploy in the heartland of India. The minister was looking at me intently, a half smile on his lips. For me, it was the moment of truth. Any half-baked answer would open the door. 'I am fully aware of the situation on the ground, Minister. It is a socio-economic and governance issue and needs to be addressed accordingly. At the same time, this is not a secessionist movement and it would not be correct to use the army against our own people.' My answer did not imply that the people in Kashmir or the Northeast where the army was deployed in anti-insurgency duties were not our own people. In both those regions, as in the Punjab of the 1980s, the insurgents had safe havens across the border and the movements were fanned and stoked by hostile countries. The Maoist problem, ruthless and dangerous as it was, had to be tackled by security forces other than the army. We could offer all the support that the Home Ministry wanted by way of training and logistics, but to get involved in a guerrilla war would impact the operational efficacy of the army. I was determined not to let that happen. The smile never left the minister's face; he was much too suave to show any emotion, but I could sense he hadn't liked my reply.",0);

He was nonchalant about the whole thing, drawing whatever amused him in that moment—kind of the same way teenage boys draw penises on bathroom stalls—except this was Picasso, so his bathroom-stall penises were more like cubist/impressionist awesomeness laced on top of faint coffee stains. Anyway, some woman sitting near him was looking on in awe. After a few moments, Picasso finished his coffee and crumpled up the napkin to throw away as he left. The woman stopped him. \"Wait,\" she said. \"Can I have that napkin you were just drawing on? I'll pay you for it.\" \"Sure,\" Picasso replied. \"Twenty thousand dollars.\" The woman's head jolted back as if he had just flung a brick at her. \"What? It took you like two minutes to draw that.\" \"No, ma'am,\" Picasso said. \"It took me over sixty years to draw this.\" He stuffed the napkin in his pocket and walked out of the café. Improvement at anything is based on thousands of tiny failures, and the magnitude of your success is based on how many times you've failed at something. If someone is better than you at something, then it's likely because she has failed at it more than you have. If someone is worse than you, it's likely because he hasn't been through all of the painful learning experiences you have. Better values, as we saw, are process-oriented. Something like \"Express myself honestly to others,\" a metric for the value \"honesty,\" is never completely finished; it's a problem that must continuously be reengaged. Every new conversation, every new relationship, brings new challenges and opportunities for honest expression. The value is an ongoing, lifelong process that defies completion. If your metric for the value \"success by worldly standards\" is \"Buy a house and a nice car,\" and you spend twenty years working your ass off to achieve it, once it's achieved the metric has nothing left to give you. Then say hello to your midlife crisis, because the problem that drove you your entire adult life was just taken away from you. There are no other opportunities to keep growing and improving, and yet it's growth that generates happiness, not a long list of arbitrary achievements. In this sense, goals, as they are conventionally defined—graduate from college, buy a lake house, lose fifteen pounds—are limited in the amount of happiness they can produce in our lives. They may be helpful when pursuing quick, short-term benefits, but as guides for the overall trajectory of our life, they suck. Picasso remained prolific his entire life. He lived into his nineties and continued to produce art up until his final years. Had his metric been \"Become famous\" or \"Make a buttload of money in the art world\" or \"Paint one thousand pictures,\" he would have stagnated at some point along the way. He would have been overcome by anxiety or self-doubt. He likely wouldn't have improved and innovated his craft in the ways he did decade after decade. The reason for Picasso's success is exactly the same reason why, as an old man, he was happy to scribble drawings on a napkin alone in a café. His underlying value was simple and humble. And it was endless. It was the value \"honest expression.\" And this is what made that napkin so valuable. ",0);

But information technology changed the nature of the narrative, changed even the city's name from a noun to a verb; Barack Obama publicly objected to American jobs being Bangalored. The hype and triumphalism of IT's unstoppable march led many to believe that the industry had sprouted in the city by happenstance. Actually, history and planning had combined to develop Bangalore, unnoticed at the time, into a hub of futuristic growth. Tipu Sultan himself started it. As early as the 1780s his engineers had invented rocketry, terrorizing the British. The colonizers on their part chose Bangalore as the headquarters of the oldest of the three engineering groups of the British Indian Army—the Madras Sappers. It was this centre that developed the Bangalore Torpedo, a mine-clearing weapon used in the First and Second World Wars and still in the armoury of many armies. Diwan Seshadri Iyer began harnessing waterfalls and in 1904 Bangalore became the first Indian city to have streets lighted by electricity. Sir M (as Diwan M. Visvesvaraya was popularly known) did the rest with his slogan 'Industrialize or Perish'. He invited Walchand Hirachand to start Hindustan Aircraft Factory, today's HAL, in Bangalore. He also persuaded Jamshetji Tata to set up the (Tata, and later Indian) Institute of Science on 371 acres of land contributed by the Maharaja of Mysore. That turned Bangalore into a focal point of advanced scientific research. C. V. Raman, who became its first Indian director, later opened his own Indian Academy of Sciences and the Raman Research Institute a few kilometres away. When India began its pioneering space programmes, Bangalore became the headquarters of ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation). A hundred engineering colleges also sprouted in the city in a span of a few years. Trained manpower, an English-speaking environment, availability of land and pleasant weather were in place waiting for the wunderkinds of the world. Then a small company named Infosys, founded in Pune in 1981, moved to Bangalore. In 1982 a Maharashtra-based family-owned vegetable oils trader of pre-Independence vintage decided to diversify, and opened its headquarters in Bangalore as Wipro. Few paid attention to these unfamiliar companies doing unfamiliar things.

If this were the corporate credo with which CRISIL had operated, it would never have been the iconic organisation that it is today. The company was founded on the bedrock of independence and credibility. Almost all business decisions that were taken invariably found their genesis in an unwavering desire to be independent of undue external influence on their operations and decision-making. The need to be profitable arose from this desire for independence, since being profitable lent financial strength that imparted the ability to be truly independent and preempted business pressures from affecting objectivity of analysis. This subjugation of business profits to an organisational ideology went counter to the prevalent corporate mindset at the time as was famously summed up by Peter Drucker, a renowned management expert and thinker, in 'The Practice of Management': \"Management must always, in every decision and action, put economic performance first\". Recalls Shah proudly: \"We were profitable from day one. And that's by design because we wanted to remain independent in thought.\" In order to understand this facet of CRISIL, it is perhaps necessary to understand the way it looked at its business. Or rather what it defined as its business. Avers Bhargava, Board Member of CRISIL: \"Our business is a business of confidence.\" Rating fees were charged upfront and the fee was paid by the client for the rating services, not the rating itself. That fundamental difference in how CRISIL viewed services rendered versus consideration received aligned client expectations with how the rating was done and not with what the rating outcome was. The customer was paying for the means i.e., the rating process, rather than the end, or the rating outcome – a business anomaly if ever there was any. But that was precisely what CRISIL had set out to achieve: credibility which customers would pay for. Sudhir Nair, Head of CRISIL Research, puts it rather pithily: \"Unilever sells soaps and detergents, we sell credibility.\" What was rather unique in the whole process was that CRISIL looked at each rating exercise as a matter of weighing up the client who had paid to be rated, against the investor who used the rating to make an investment and pricing decision with respect to the debt instrument rated.

Most often he stays in a guest room, but he's also been known to crash on the couch after winding down with some video games. Then it's back to Los Angeles and SpaceX on Thursday. He shares custody of his five young boys-twins and triplets with his ex-wife, Justine, and has them four days a week. Each year, Musk tabulates the amount of flight time he endures per week to help him get a sense of just how out of hand things are getting. Asked how he survives this schedule, Musk said, \"I had a tough childhood, so maybe that was helpful.\" \n\nDuring one visit to Musk Land, he had to squeeze our inter view in before heading off for a camping trip at Crater Lake National Park in Oregon. It was almost 8 PM on a Friday, Musk would soon be piling his boys and nannies into his private jet and then meeting drivers who would take him to his friends the campsite; the friends would then help the Musk clan unpack and complete their pitch-black arrival. There would be a bit of hiking over the weekend. Then the relaxation would end. Musk would fly with the boys back to Los Angeles on Sunday after noon. Then, he would take off on his own that evening for New York. Sleep. Hit the morning talk shows on Monday. Meetings E-mail. Sleep. Fly back to Los Angeles Tuesday morning. Work at SpaceX. Fly to San Jose Tuesday afternoon to visit the Tesla Motors factory. Fly to Washington, D.C., that night and see President Obama. Fly back to Los Angeles Wednesday night. Spend a couple of days working at SpaceX. Then go to a weekend conference held by Google's chairman, Eric Schmidt, in Yellow stone. At this time, Musk had just split from his second wife, the actress Talulah Riley, and was trying to calculate if he could mix a personal life into all of this. \"I think the time allocated to the businesses and the kids is going fine,\" Musk said. \"I would like to allocate more time to dating, though. I need to find a girlfriend. That's why I need to carve out just a little more time. I think maybe even another five to ten-how much time does a woman want a week? Maybe ten hours? That's kind of the minimum I don't know.\"",0);

In some versions, Ganesha simply twirls around and declares himself winner. When asked for an explanation for this audacious declaration, Ganesha tells Kartikeya, \"You went around your world: the objective world of things. I went around my world: a subjective world of thoughts. What matters more?\" With a typical Indian headshake, head bobbing from side to side, Kartikeya smiles and replies, \"Depends!\"\n\nEverything depends on our beliefs: the lens of subjective truth that helps us make sense of the world.\n\nThe Western lens clubs India and China as the exotic, where the symbolic is preferred over the literal. It seeks the truth and believes there is only one life with one goal. It is most concerned with the what of business\n\nThe Chinese lens clubs India and the West as Indo-European, for being overly speculative rather than pragmatic. It seeks order and believes in keeping out chaos. It is most concerned with the how of business.\n\nThe Indian lens clubs China and the West as materialistic for valuing things rather than thoughts. It seeks peace as the mind is very aware of different goals of different people in different contexts or different lifetimes. It is most concerned with the why of business.\n\nIn this chapter, we shall gaze upon these beliefs and learn to appreciate the diversity of human thought. Only when the horizon is broadened can we begin our journey into the gaze-based approach to management.\n\nThe ideas presented here are neither politically correct nor academically certified, as sweeping generalizations need to be made to ascertain a pattern, which is buried under layers of forms. This book will also not answer questions as to what actually defines the West. India' and 'China': are these historical, geographical, political, religious or cultural terms? Any attempt to answer these questions will burn the ship at the port before any exploration can begin. The approach may not please those who seek validation of their religious scientific or secular beliefs. For the rest, this book will open a new world of seeing. It will reveal that people today, stripped of modern technology and language, continue to see the world exactly as their ancestors did a thousand years ago.

        insertIntoExcerptsTable(db,10,"The Nascent Years of CRISIL","It was a windy afternoon in 1991 in coastal Bombay as the endless stream of black and yellow cabs slackened their pace and cruised along the Worli Seaface in anticipation of passengers too weary to battle the humid September heat. The waters of the Arabian Sea tested their might against the breakers adjoining the Worli Seaface and left the afternoon strollers drenched in spray. As the sun slanted across the bluish-grey skies, a slightly built man in a white formal shirt and pinstripe trousers typical of bankers and stock market brokers quickened his pace on the opposite side of the road. His intelligent eyes quickly scanned the front page of the leading business fortnightly in his hand once again, as if to reassure himself. The headline from The Illustrated Weekly of India screamed: \"The capital markets may be flooded with junk bonds\". A thin smile crossed his lips as the man continued his half-jog up the road before disappearing around the bend. Three blocks away, the man in whites and pinstripes walked through the gates of Nirlon House on the staid Dr. Annie Besant Road and took the elevator to the second level. He made his way into the spotless offices of The Credit Rating Information Services of India Ltd (now CRISIL) and walked straight into the Managing Director's cabin. He was a man in a hurry. The surprised staff looked on, relief and curiosity writ large on their faces. Relief because the disarming smile was back on their boss' face after three straight days of pensiveness and unrest. Curiosity because their leader, although a passionate man, had rarely shown such exuberance before. They watched as Pradip Panalal Shah, founding Managing Director of CRISIL, reached across his mahogany desk for the telephone from amidst a slew of neatly stacked office files and folders of reports. The beige-coloured instrument bobbed as Shah's fingers flew across its number pad. He was calling a number he had used a million times before in the past five years. A gravelly baritone picked up on the fourth ring. His eyes gleaming as he again eyed the headlines in front of him, Shah waited with bated breath. He didn't have to say anything. \"Congratulations, Pradip! Your effort has paid off.\" The baritone belonged to Narayanan Vaghul, Shah's mentor and Chairman of CRISIL. \"Sir, you were right from day one!\" Shah was equally effusive in returning the encomiums. After decades of regulation of debenture interest rates by the Reserve Bank of India, the Government of India had finally abolished the ceiling on debenture interest rates and freed up the debt markets in India. Interest rates on debt instruments could now be aligned with the underlying risk in the instruments. One of the inadvertent beneficiaries of this policy reform was CRISIL, India's first and only credit rating agency in the eighties that provided rating services for debt instruments and had for years seen growth hampered by a market not conducive to debt rating services. CRISIL's journey had begun more than three years earlier, when it was incorporated on 29th January 1987. The seeds for the idea called CRISIL had been planted much earlier — in 1986 — when Pradip Shah was the General Manager of HDFC, a pioneer and leader in housing finance in India. Shah had helped set up and grow HDFC from Rs. 70 million in 1978-79 to about Rs. 10 billion in loans sanctioned by 1987 and had earned a reputation as a go-getter with an entrepreneurial streak. The early and mid-eighties in India were characterised by frenzied capital market activity culminating in the stock market boom of 1985-86. There had been a phenomenal increase in the capital raised and number of industrial projects launched. This was accompanied by rising project costs, and — with the onset of liberalisation — increased competition. This had resulted in greater likelihood of corporate default and failure of businesses. As if to drive the point home, investors got a nasty shock in 1986 when Nirlon, a reputed synthetic fibre manufacturer, halted interest payments on Rs. 270 million of debentures a year after they were issued. Owing to the wealth of financial information available at its disposal, the corporate think-tank at ICICI was well aware of the unfolding story in Indian capital markets and was keenly looking at a solution around debt rating. B V Bhargava and S V Shah from the project appraisals department of ICICI were front-ending the effort and had conducted parleys with foreign rating agencies like S&P's and Moody's who were reluctant to enter India at that point. Thus was born the idea of indigenously building an Indian rating agency from scratch. Recalls Deepak Parekh, Chairman of Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), a pioneer and leader in housing finance in India and Shah's boss: \"Vaghul had the passion. He also had complete backing from the entire ICICI set-up. Everyone knew that an independent rating agency not only improved risk assessment, it also enhanced the quality of papers which institutions hold. Since we could not forge an international collaboration at that time, we built a homemade rating agency.\"",0);

Bangalore gathered the energy to challenge the crass and the coarse. Civic activists made a difference by avoiding confrontationist ways. They accepted that the plundering class needed no reasons for plundering, they only needed pretexts. The activists reduced the pretexts by partnering with government agencies. They scored some successes, Nandan Nilekani claiming, in 2008, that 'the urban movement has turned the corner and the momentum to improve our cities is now unstoppable'. The movement certainly helped soften the tyranny of the elected. Is that enough? If Nilekani the optimist is off the mark, Bangalore is in trouble. Nature herself has started protesting in ways that are impossible to ignore. Bangalore's largest waterbody, the 700-acre Bellandur Lake turned into a menacing expanse of white foam and then caught fire in mid-2015. The stagnation of accumulated sewage had produced methane gas that was inflammable. Sewage management has been a mess for years. The late N. S. Ramaswamy, founder-director of the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore, used to describe the city corporation's Bangalore Water Supply and Sewage Board as the Bangalore Sewage Supply and Water Board. Nobody cared. Since then a scary warning has come from V. Balasubramanian, former additional chief secretary of Karnataka. According to him, water scarcity and contamination will force the government to evacuate half of Bangalore's population by 2023. 'Bangalore is growing,' he said, 'without realizing that it is actually dying.' Bangalore was always unfriendly to people with bronchial problems. Now air pollution has made it difficult even for the healthy to stay that way. The Whitefield Industrial Zone has RSPM (respirable suspended particulate matter) levels at 283 per cent in excess of permissible levels, and areas on the Mysore Road, 248 per cent. The good news is that politicians and other destroyers of Bangalore too breathe the same toxic air. The plague of 1898 killed 2,500 citizens. The new plague, gathering pace, will wipe out more than that number. If luck holds and some of the plunderers and mutilators of Bangalore are also felled by the scourge they have unleashed, the surviving few might finally hear the question: Should Bangalore, now askew, be rightened or allowed to keel over? In the famous conclusion of his famous thesis, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1904), Max Weber referred to 'the tremendous cosmos of the modern economic order' and said: 'This order is now bound to the technical and economic conditions of machine production which today determine the lives of all individuals who are born into this mechanism, not only those directly concerned with economic acquisition, with irresistible force. Perhaps it will so determine them until the last ton of fossilized coal is burnt' and, as may be added 113 years later, the last mountain is razed, the last river is turned barren and the last square meter of land is concreted over. As the moneyed chase money, progress turns to perdition. Bangaloreans are no longer citizens; they are digits, statistics, percentages and fractions for knaves to make profits from.

I was rather surprised to see what has happened to him.\"\n\nWhile Musk didn't have any close friends at school, his eccentric interests did leave an impression. One boy-Ted Wood remembered Musk bringing model rockets to school and blasting them off during breaks. This was not the only hint of his aspirations. During a science-class debate, Elon gained attention for railing against fossil fuels in favor of solar power-an almost sacreligious stance in a country devoted to mining the earth's natu ral resources. \"He always had firm views on things,\" said Wood. Terence Beney, a classmate who stayed in touch with Elon over the years, claimed that Musk had started fantasizing about colo nizing other planets in high school as well.\n\nIn another nod to the future, Elon and Kimbal were chatting during a class break outdoors when Wood interrupted them and asked what they were going on about. 'They said, We are talking about whether there is a need for branch banking in the finan coal industry and whether we will move to paperless banking.' I remember thinking that was such an absurd comment to make. I said, 'Yeah, that's great.'\n\nWhile Musk might not have been among the academic elite in his class, he was among a handful of students with the grades and self-professed interest to be selected for an experimental computer program. Students were plucked out of a number of schools and brought together to learn the BASIC, COBOL, and Pascal programming languages. Musk continued to augment these technological leanings with his love of science fiction and fantasy and tried his hand at writing stories that involved dragons and supernatural beings. \"I wanted to write something like Lord of the Rings,\" he said.\n\nMaye viewed these high school years through a mother's eyes and recounted plenty of tales of Musk performing spectacular academic feats. The video game he wrote, she said, impressed much older, more experienced techies. He aced math exams well beyond his years. And he had that incredible memory. The only pason he did not outrank the other boys was a lack of interest in the work prescribed by the school.\nAs Musk saw it, \"I just look at it as What grades do I need to get where I want to go? There were compulsory subjects like Afrikaans, and I just didn't see the point of learning that. It seemed ridiculous. I'd get a passing grade and that was fine. Things like physics and computers-I got the highest grade you can get in those. There needs to be a reason for a grade. I'd rather play video games, write software, and read books than try and get an A if there's no point in getting an A. I can remember failing subjects in like fourth and fifth grade. Then, my mother's boyfriend told me I'd be held back if I didn't pass. I didn't actually know you had to pass the subjects to move to the next grade. I got the best grades in class after that.\"",0);

Rules state that as a member of the royal family, Arjun has the right to hold the bow. The same right is not given to Karna and Eklavya because Karna belongs to a family of charioteers who are servants, while Eklavya is a tribal who lives in the forest. Karna has to learn secretly, denying his identity to his teacher. Eklavya has to learn on his own as the royal tutor, Drona, refuses to teach him. The social structure of the land is anything but fair.\n\nRules that are meant to subvert the law of the jungle end up creating a culture that is unfair and oppressive. Hence, the god in Hinduism is not just a rule-follower like Ram but also a rule-breaker as in the instance of Krishna. Krishna is leela purushottam who is best at playing games. He is always visualized as a cowherd and charioteer, members of the servant class, even though he is born into a royal family. He seems to be mocking social status\n\nThe point is not the rules, or the following or breaking of them, but the reason behind the rules. Are they helping the helpless as they are supposed to or are they simply granting more power to the powerful? Rules were created to keep the jungle out of society but more often than not they become tools to make society worse than any jungle.\n\nMathias knows that because he is the eldest son of the family, his taking over as CEO of his departmental store will always be seen as a function of his bloodline rather than a result of his talent. No matter how hard he works, no matter what his performance is when compared with other professionals in the company, he will always be his father's son. He is the modern-day Arjun, found in almost every family business. In contrast, Mathur knows that despite years of proving himself, he will never become the CEO; he is not part of the family bloodline and the family will never give the mantle to a professional. He is our modern-day Karna, who leaves the family business and joins a professional company, only to realize that even a multinational company has a glass ceiling. He is not an alumnus of any known business- school hence he will never be good enough. He will always be the outsider Bakshi works as a manager in the very same departmental store. He would have been a part of the strategic team but he will never be, because he is not a business-school graduate either. No school accepted him because in the group discussions he would only express himself in Hindi. His thoughts were outstanding but those who judged him heard only his language and felt he would not fit in because he did not know English.Bakshi did not learn English since the government schools he studied in taught only the local language, because the political parties insisted on supporting the regional language over a foreign language, never mind the fact that the children of these very politicians went to English-medium schools.

These key questions remain unanswered even after a high-level inquiry conducted by a three-member United Nations Commission, to investigate the events and circumstances surrounding the assassination of Benazir Bhutto. The UN team, which took almost nine months to complete its inquiry report, cited a major lapse in her security plan and squarely blamed Pakistan's former military dictator, General (retd) Pervez Musharraf, for her murder. The report released by the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on 15 April 2010, twenty-eight months after the assassination, made it abundantly clear that Benazir Bhutto had been left completely at the mercy of her killers, who took advantage of the poor security arrangements and assassinated her. Those who masterminded her murder still remain nameless, although the UN Commission had asked the Pakistan government to carry out a criminal investigation of both the suicide attacks on Benazir Bhutto, the first in Karachi on 18 October 2007, and the second in Rawalpindi on 27 December 2007 (which resulted in her death), to expose all those involved not only on an operational level but also in the conception, planning and financing of the murder. Having spent nine years in exile, Benazir Bhutto had returned to Pakistan to lead her party's election campaign for a third term in office. She had left Pakistan in 1998 along with her three children, to live in Dubai and London, two years after being deposed as prime minister, in November 1996. She had been in self-imposed exile after the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had arrested her husband Asif Zardari, and booked her in several corruption cases. Although the Sharif government was toppled by General Musharraf in October 1999, Benazir Bhutto continued to lead the PPP while staying out of the country. She was eventually joined by her husband in 2004, after he was freed from jail. Benazir Bhutto subsequently decided to return to Pakistan on 18 October 2007 to campaign for the 2008 general elections. As she landed at Karachi airport, the streets of the city were flooded with hundreds of thousands of jubilant PPP workers and supporters who had come out to welcome her. But while she was being taken to the mausoleum of Mohammad Ali Jinnah to address a rally, her homecoming procession was attacked by a couple of suicide bombers near the Karsaz area of the port city. Fortunately, Bhutto escaped unhurt but the twin suicide attacks killed over 170 people, including innocent women and children and six police officers. At least fifty security guards from the PPP who had formed a human chain around her truck to keep potential bombers away were also killed. Bhutto's cavalcade had been inching through Karachi for nearly ten hours, and it so happened that she had gone down to the command centre of the truck to remove her sandals and rest her swollen feet, moments before the bomb went off. She was escorted unharmed from the scene. However, exactly seventy days after her return to Pakistan, and barely two weeks before the holding of the general elections, which were originally scheduled for 8 January 2008, Benazir Bhutto was assassinated. Benazir Bhutto's murder was only the most recent in a bloody South Asian political terrain, rife with assassinations. Pakistan's first prime minister, Liaqat Ali Khan, was shot dead in 1951 inside the same park—it was subsequently named Liaqat Bagh in his honour—which Bhutto was leaving after a meeting, when she was killed. In India, Mohandas Gandhi was shot dead in 1948, soon after Independence. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated in 1984, and her son and successor, Rajiv Gandhi, who was Benazir Bhutto's contemporary and counterpart, was also killed, in 1991, by a suicide bomber who belonged to a Sri Lankan Tamil separatist group. In Sri Lanka itself, several politicians, Sinhala and Tamil, were killed; and in Bangladesh, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman—the first prime minister who later became President of the country—had been shot dead in a bloody military coup in 1975. In 1981, another Bangladeshi President, Ziaur Rahman, was killed in yet another abortive coup. In 1988, Pakistan's third military dictator, General Zia ul Haq, was killed in a mysterious plane crash along with others in the top rung of the country's military hierarchy. Therefore, Benazir Bhutto knew quite well that her return to Pakistan was fraught with serious risks. A few moments before being killed, she had addressed a mammoth election rally in the historic Liaqat Bagh of Rawalpindi. She was happy as the rally had gone quite well. After it was over, she got into her bulletproof white Toyota Land Cruiser and left Liaqat Bagh, travelling in convoy. The fleet of vehicles consisted of a black Toyota Land Cruiser, which was being used by Tauqir Kaira, followed by Bhutto's white armoured Land Cruiser with two of Kaira's vehicles on either side of it—a Mercedes-Benz van on the right and a four-door double-cabin car on the left. Immediately behind those vehicles were two Toyota Vigo pickup trucks, positioned side by side. A bulletproof black Mercedes-Benz, which was the backup car for Bhutto, had already left the parking area ahead of her Land Cruiser. Tauqir Kaira, who was responsible for providing the first line of defence around Bhutto's convoy, was inside the lead vehicle with his private security men. Kaira was also in charge of handling the logistics of getting Bhutto's convoy on the way—checking the vehicles and ensuring that they were in the proper place, and so on. Accompanying Bhutto in her vehicle were Javed-ur-Rehman (driver), Major (retd) Imtiaz Ahmed (chief security officer), Makhdoom Amin Fahim (senior vice chairman of the PPP), Naheed Khan (Bhutto's political secretary), Safdar Abbasi (senior PPP leader), Khalid Shahenshah (a PPP activist) and Razaq Mirani (Benazir's personal attendant). Kaira's two vehicles on either side of Bhutto's Land Cruiser carried his men and the Vigo pickup trucks carried her personal security guards. Riding in the black Mercedes-Benz were the driver, PPP spokesman Farhatullah Babar, Rehman Malik (now federal interior minister), Babar Awan (now federal law minister) and Lieutenant General (retd) Tauqir Zia, a former corps commander who had joined the PPP a few weeks ago. As her vehicle was moving slowly, she noticed that many of the PPP workers and supporters carrying banners and placards were waving at her. So a smiling Bhutto emerged from the sunroof of the jeep to wave to the cheering crowd. Someone from the crowd shouted, 'Bhutto de naray,' (The slogans of Bhutto) and she joined her supporters to yell 'wajan ge' (shall go on being chanted). Those were her last words. While she was waving to the crowd, a man wearing dark glasses appeared on the left side of Bhutto's bulletproof Land Cruiser. He suddenly pulled out a pistol and fired three shots at her from a close range of two to three metres. All three shots were fired in less than a second. Bhutto's white scarf (with which she had covered her head) and her hair flicked upwards after the second shot, and she was seen falling into the vehicle after the third shot was fired. The gunman, who was near the left rear corner of her vehicle, then lowered his gun, looked down and detonated his explosive-laden jacket, wreaking havoc. Those accompanying her believe at least one bullet hit her on the right side of her head, slightly above her temple, and that the bomber had blown himself up after she had slumped back inside the vehicle and hit the seat. Collapsing thus, she fell in Naheed Khan's lap, away from the senior vice chairman of the PPP, Makhdoom Amin Fahim, who was sitting on her left. Seconds later, those inside the vehicle with Bhutto noticed that her face and neck were badly bloodied. As blood poured from her left temple and pooled in the back seat, Bhutto lost consciousness. According to Naheed Khan, she cradled her leader's head in her lap and tried to stem the flow of blood with her dupatta. Naheed's husband, Dr Safdar Abbasi, who was sitting at the back, immediately checked Bhutto's pulse, but there was no sign of life. According to him, she seemed to have died instantly because of the severity of the head injury. Major Imtiaz Ahmed, Bhutto's chief security officer who was driving her vehicle at the time, had the presence of mind to drive the badly-damaged jeep as fast as he could, from the site of the blast towards the Rawalpindi General Hospital (RGH). After a kilometre, the vehicle came to a halt as its tyres gave out. Imtiaz found a vehicle belonging to Sherry Rehman (PPP's central secretary, information) parked at the kerb with only the driver behind the wheel, waiting for passengers. A bleeding Bhutto was quickly shifted to that vehicle, and her aides desperately sought to get her medical care. Once they reached the hospital, a seven-member team of surgeons and doctors worked to save her life, and even resorted to open-heart massage. The political heir of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was, however, declared dead on the operating table at around 6.30 p.m. It was left to Dr Safdar Abbasi to break the news to Asif Zardari, who was in Dubai. He is reported to have said, 'I won't believe it unless I see it myself.' But soon, Zardari had the difficult task of telling his children that their mother had died. In one of her interviews, Benazir Bhutto had said that she would like to see her children get married before she died. 'I remember, when I met my father for the last time in jail, he told me that he would not see any of his children get married. I would say that I'd like to see my children get married and then see my grandchildren. I pray God protects my life till then. …' But it was not to be.",0);

As Jack later explained, \"I needed to stop eBay to protect Alibaba.\" Although Each Net was targeting consumers, not the businesses served by Alibaba, Jack was concerned that some of the larger merchants active on EachNet could encroach on Alibaba's turf: \"At that time, there were only two companies in China that understood online marketplaces, eBay and Alibaba. I was particularly concerned that eBay power sellers would grow their business to compete in the B2B space.\"\n\nJack's plans to target consumers encountered resistance within Alibaba. The B2B business wasn't yet profitable, and the VC market was closed for the time being. Could the company really afford to open a new front when they were still fighting the B2B battle? Was Jack just being paranoid?\n\nCTO John Wu adamantly opposed the idea, visiting Jack the night before the new project was kicked off. John warned Jack that the move would harm Alibaba: \"How on earth could you fight against eBay?\" Jack replied that the market was still open: \"There are one hundred million Internet users today, but only five million people are doing online shopping.\" Jack's ambitious plans for Alibaba also gave him a different perspective: \"eBay wants to buy the Chinese market, but we want to create China's Internet trading market.\" With his firsthand experience as a small business owner in Zhejiang, Jack was adamant that the threat from eBay was real: \"In China, there are so many small businesses that people don't make a clear distinction between business and consumer. Small business and consumer behavior are very similar. One person makes the decisions for the whole organization.\" Jack also understood the temptation for eBay, later reflecting, \"We launched Taobao not to make money, but because in the U.S.eBay gets a lot of its revenue from small businesses. We knew that someday eBay would come in our direction.\"\n\nSo it was decided. Alibaba would target the consumer e-commerce market. Jack was emboldened after a trip at the end of 2002 to Tokyo, where he found Masayoshi Son in a buoyant mood. Yahoo Japan had just repelled eBay from its shores, boosting SoftBank's standing after several painful years of dot-com write-downs. SoftBank signed up to commit $80 million to Alibaba's new venture. The project was kept highly confidential. Few within Alibaba were even aware that the idea of targeting consumers in China had been contemplated, let alone that a team had actually been formed to code a new website. Secrecy, and some useful Alibaba folklore, was achieved by sequestering a handful of employees, including Alibaba cofounder Toto Sun, in the original Lakeside apartment where Alibaba had been founded Two years later Jack recalled the scene as he invited a half dozen, handpicked employees to his office: \"Our COO, CFO, the vice president of HR, and I were all there. We talked to them one by one: The company has decided to send you to do a project, but you are required to leave your home, and you must not tell your parents or your boyfriend or your girlfriend. Do you agree? Holed up in the small apartment, the team got to work. In taking on eBay, Jack wanted to preserve the element of surprise. Explaining his strategy, he dipped into his reservoir of martial arts stories: \"I've seen lots of people yelling 'Fight the Shaolin Temple!' at the foot of the Shaolin Temple: that's complete nonsense. However, if I reach your doorstep to challenge you, I pretty much know that I will defeat you. In the future there will be no need to yell; as soon as you stand on the doorstep, people will be scared.\"\n\nThroughout the project, Jack emphasized that their target was not EachNet but eBay itself. Once the project became public knowledge, he wanted to ensure the fight was seen as a David versus Goliath struggle.One team members recalled the mood: \"We were just a group of country bumpkins, and our competitor was eBay.\" Reuters later summed up the culture as \"kung fu commerce with a dash of theater.\" To keep up morale the small group of software engineers took breaks between coding to play video games or do exercises. Jack encouraged the team to do handstands. As a child, he explained, looking at the world upside down had given him a different perspective on life. The new business was to be named \"hunting for treasure,\" or taobao in Chinese. Taobao.com's tagline was \"There is no treasure that cannot be hunted out, and there is no treasure that cannot be sold.\"\n\nTaobao was officially launched on May 10, 2003, celebrated each year as \"Aliday,\" a \"take your family to work\" day and the date of the company's famous group wedding celebration. Aliday celebrates the team spirit that helped Alibaba overcome an unexpected challenge that tested its employees as never before.\"",0);
        insertIntoExcerptsTable(db,11,"'You bastards killed her!'","That afternoon Swaranpreet was in—or so he thought then— the safe confines of his home in a middle class west Delhi colony and recollected the moment when he had parked his scooter in Safdarjung Hospital where he was interning to become a surgeon. The morning was etched frame by frame in his mind and so were the events that had forced him to give up surgery and take up psychiatry to specialise in post-trauma recovery. Swaranpreet would have laughed if someone had prophesied that in less than two decades, he would cease to be an Indian citizen and have a Greek wife! Part of a small clan of Sikhs from Kashmir—originally Kashmiri Brahmins—Swaranpreet's father performed service in Sikh temples and despite starting life as an unlettered person, later went on to become a historian. He was obviously a man of modest means, but the family—including another son and a daughter—got by and lived comfortably. Swaranpreet was a conscientious student in school, and graduated from the Government Medical College, Jammu in the summer of 1984. On 31 October, anticipating a fresh posting, the young doctor arrived in his grey-colour Chetak scooter which he parked in the usual place and went to the ward at the appointed time. Like others in the medical profession, Swaranpreet was used to nurses and other hospital staff being obsequious and was taken aback when the clerk who routinely informed him about his assignments, took off on seeing him. 'You bastards killed her!' Swaranpreet realised instantly that the situation warranted action. The young doctor asked around: some said that there were rumours that Indira Gandhi had been gunned down by her Sikh bodyguards, while others were guarded in their replies. Swaranpreet ventured outside with a colleague and the two dressed in doctors' overalls, crossed the road and stayed inside the AIIMS campus for close to three hours. At some point, several dignitaries were seen inside AIIMS and many more after BBC's announcement of Indira Gandhi's death. By the time Swaranpreet's colleague advised him to go home, the road outside AIIMS was completely choked and even as he struggled to get out of the gate, there were mixed responses— someone swore at him, others were crying out of shock and some were genuinely grieving for the woman who lay dead inside the hospital. Suddenly, someone hit Swaranpreet on the back of his head. He reacted typically, as a Sikh would do in such a situation and held on to his turban. Years later, he would take it off permanently for completely different reasons and instead of feeling persecuted for being forced into a decision, he would feel relieved that he was finally able to make the choice. But on that afternoon, rapid blows rained on his head. Although he managed to escape without any serious injuries, it left him badly shaken. Out on the street, he hailed an auto-rickshaw and the non-Sikh driver agreed to take him home. On the way, Swaranpreet calmed himself down, stopped the auto-rickshaw midway and retied his turban. When he entered his house after more than an hour, he was convinced what he had witnessed on Delhi's streets was general outrage and nowhere near organised violence. He was forced to change his mind over the next couple of days, as he did in the following months and years....",0);
